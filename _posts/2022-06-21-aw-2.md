It is near impossible to think that our first day was three weeks ago! While, it seems like we just started, I wanted to look back a bit along the way to the icebreaker that left a lasting impression on us all.

Nerves running high for starting a new process, with names, pronouns, and fun facts shared, we gathered as a team along the whiteboards in the Digital Media Lab, which would become our homey little cave for the next ten weeks. In pairs we played reverse pictionary, where one person stood with their back to another and described an image that the person at the whiteboard had to draw based only on description. As we discussed in the aftermath of the icebreaker, this was an excellent and silly way not only to become more comfortable with one another, but also to consider the concept of perspective which will be integral to success in creating the Critical Web Design Toolkit. "Could you describe that a different way?" was a simple yet common question representative of the vastly different interpretations people can have with what seem like intuitive instructions to the one giving them.

The first round was fun, spent for me describing a truck that was mostly a truck when I turned around to view Cameron's craftsmanship, but the second round something truly magical happened.

If you have noticed across our site four strange, remarkable creatures, this is their origin. While we have yet to name them, three weeks later they remain on the whiteboards of the Digital Media Lab. In just a few short minutes on our first day, through an icebreaker that comments on perspective, we created these lasting symbols of our project work together. Oh, and we also think they would make an awesome band, but that's a story for another time. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do!
