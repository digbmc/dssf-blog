**The Critical Web Design Toolkit**  <br>
The Critical Web Design Toolkit Project focuses on building a static website for the community to use for various digital scholarship projects. The project also aims to provide user-friendly, informative documentation about the steps needed to follow in order to be able to use the static site builder efficiently. The underlying reasons behind constructing a static website builder starts from stressing on the environmental consequences that occur due to energy consumption by websites to handling issues surrounding accessibility, digital divide and other social and moral implications of web development tools.

 **Why use a Static Site?**  <br>
Website performance is a crucial factor when it comes to running websites. In this aspect, static sites are very fast by nature as they serve the same HTML without any dynamic rendering. Static sites are also relatively safer when it comes to security breaches as there is no database to breach and no server-side platform with unpatched vulnerabilities. Moreover, hosting static sites are very inexpensive and even free depending on an individual's preferences. Static sites are also very flexible to work with as there is no limitation about building a site, and on top of that, it is very easy to keep track of using version control systems like Git and Github.
