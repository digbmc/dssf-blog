Arlowe is a Linguistics major with an intended Visual Studies minor. They are interested in exploring visual representations of data through Digital Scholarship, as it rests at the cross-section of their current academic focus. More broadly in their studies, he seeks to research interactions between textual to visual narratives and intermedia work as it applies to the digital arts and humanities. They cannot wait to share the resources in development this summer with the rest of the Bryn Mawr community!
